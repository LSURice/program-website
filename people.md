name="Adam Famoso" 

position="Principal investigator"

pic="img/people/adam_profile_pic.jpg"

top-p1="Dr. Famoso is an Associate Professor at LSU and leads the rice breeding
progam at the H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station. The
breeding program has a comprehensive field testing component, winter nursery,
a SNP DNA marker lab, and strives to incorporate enabling technologies 
from multiple disciplines. Varieties developed by the program are widely grown 
across Louisiana and the Southern U.S. rice production region. Research efforts 
in the Famoso lab are aimed at identifying, 
prioritizing, and validating new technologies and approaches
within the logistical context of an applied breeding program."

top-p2="Dr. Famoso recieved an Associate Degree from Paul Smith's 
College in upstate New York in Urban Forestry. He then went on to obtain
a BS in Horticulture from Penn State University, and a PhD
in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Cornell University. During his PhD he 
worked in the lab of Dr. Susan McCouch studying the genetics of aluminum 
tolerance in rice. Prior to his position at LSU, he worked as a Research Scientist at
DuPont Pioneer. His work was focused on implementing markers in the 
hybrid rice breeding program."

top-p1="Dr. Angira is an Assistant Professor at LSU.
His current research is focused on developing and
integrating molecular markers into the breeding program.
In addition to leading the marker lab and genetics research, he oversees 
the medium grain rice breeding program. 
He is responsible for planning field trials, making selections, 
and advances lines through to variety release."

top-p2="Dr. Angira received his masters from West Texas A&M University and
his PhD from Texas A&M Univesity in
2016, where he studied the genetics of heat tolerance in cowpea."

top-p1="Chris is a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Adam Famoso based 
at Cornell University in the Lab of Dr. Kelly Robbins.
His work includes analyzing historical breeding data, informatics, and 
assisting with proof-of-concept experiments."

top-p2="Chris received a BS in Genetics and Agronomy in 2014 from Iowa State University,
and a PhD in Plant Breeding from Cornell University in 2019. His PhD work focused 
on using genomics to improve fruit quality traits in a winter squash breeding 
program. He has experience in field breeding, molecular breeding, bioinformatics, 
and applied quantitative genetics. [Website](https://www.chrishdz.xyz)"

top-p1="Dr. Maulana is a postdoctoral associate with Dr. Famoso. His research
involves developing, validating, and optimizing genomic prediction methodologies for
immediate application in the breeding program.
The primary goal of his research is to reduce costs, while improving breeding efficiency
and increasing genetic gain."

top-p2="
Dr. Maulana received a BS in Crop Science from Bunda College of Agriculture in Malawi. After
working as breeder in Malawi, he obtained a MS and PhD in Plant Breeding and Genetics 
from Kansas State University. At KSU, he studied cold tolerance and prediction for sorghum hybrid
performance. Most recently, as a postdoctoral researcher in the Small Grains 
Breeding Lab at the Noble Research Institute, he developed genomic selection models
and an image-based phenotyping platform for abiotic stress."
